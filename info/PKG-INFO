Description: # basicMLpy <br />
        basicMLpy is a package that implements simple machine learning algorithms. It currently contains five modules that implement multiple machine learning techniques for classification and regression.<br />
        ### The basicMLpy.regression module contains the following functionalities:
        * Linear Regression 
        * Ridge Regression 
        * Basis expanded regression, that allows for nonlinear models 
        * Error evaluation through Mean Squared Error and Huber Loss
        ### The basicMLpy.classification module contains the following functionalities:
        * Multiclass classification through the IRLS(Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares) algorithm
        * Error evaluation through accuracy and exponential loss
        ### The basicMLpy.nearest_neighbors module contains the following functionalities:
        * An implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, that can fit both classification and regression problems
        ### The basicMLpy.cross_validation module contains the following functionalities:
        * A Cross-Validation algorithm for the functions presented by the basicMLpy package
        * Functions for model selection
        ### The basicMLpy.ensemble module contains the following functionalities:
        * An implementation of the Random Forests algorithm for regression and classification
        * An implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm for classification
        * An implementation of the Gradient Boosting algorithm for regression
        ## Documentation <br />
        The documentation will be available at a proper site soon. For now it can be found in the main code for each module.<br />
        ## Installation <br />
        To install basicMLpy run the following command: <br />
        `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ basicMLpy` <br />
        ## Dependencies <br />
        basicMLpy requires Python >= 3.8, Numpy >= 1.19, scikit-learn >= 0.23. <br />
        ## On pypi <br />
        https://test.pypi.org/project/basicMLpy/<br />
        ## On Github <br />

        ## Some thoughts <br />
        This is a work in progress project, so more functionalities will be added with time. The main feature that will be implemented in the near future is a module focused on boosting methods and a module focused on kernel density estimators.
