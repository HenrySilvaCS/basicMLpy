# basicMLpy
Module that implements basic Machine Learning algorithms and techniques in python, built on top of numpy and scikit-learn libraries. <br />
The documentation for each function can be found in the main code.<br />
This is a work in progress project, so more functionalities will be added with time. The main feature that will be implemented in the near future is an AdaBooster for weak classifiers.
