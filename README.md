# basicMLpy
Module that implements basic Machine Learning algorithms and techniques, built on top of numpy and scikit-learn libraries.
This is a work in progress project, so more functionalities will be added with time. The main feature that will be implemented in the near future is a K-fold Cross-Validation algorithm.
Keep in mind that the default size ratio for the train/test samples for the input dataset is 0.8 and 0.2 respectively. I intend to change this fixed value in the future, allowing for a more customizable module.
Datasets used for testing the module are available at: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html
