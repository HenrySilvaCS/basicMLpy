# basicMLpy <br />
basicMLpy is a package that implements simple machine learning algorithms. It currently contains one module that implements regression and classification algorithms.  <br />
The basicMLpy_regression_and_classification module contains the following functionalities:
* Regression models:<br />
  * Linear Regression <br />
  * Ridge Regression <br />
  * Basis expanded regression, that allows for nonlinear models<br />
* Classification models:<br />
  * Binary classification through the IRLS(Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares) method<br />
  * K-class classification using the one-vs-all technique, also calculated through the IRLS(Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares) algorithm. <br />
## Documentation <br />
The documentation for each function can be found in the main code,i.e. basicMLpy.py file on the main branch.<br />
## Installation <br />
To install basicMLpy run the following command: <br />
`pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps basicMLpy-pkg-HENRY-SILVA` <br />
## Dependencies <br />
basicMLpy requires Python >= 3.8, Numpy >= 1.19, scikit-learn >= 0.23. <br />
## On pypi <br />
https://test.pypi.org/project/basicMLpy-pkg-HENRY-SILVA/<br />
## On Github <br />
https://github.com/HenrySilvaCS/basicMLpy
## Final thoughts <br />
This is a work in progress project, so more functionalities will be added with time. The main feature that will be implemented in the near future is a module focused on boosting methods and a module focused on kernel density estimators.
