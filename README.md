# basicMLpy
Module that implements basic Machine Learning algorithms and techniques in python, built on top of numpy and scikit-learn libraries.
The documentation for each function can be found in the main code.
This is a work in progress project, so more functionalities will be added with time. The main feature that will be implemented in the near future is an AdaBooster for weak classifiers.
Datasets used for testing the module are available at: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html
