# About the author
I started this package as a personnal project during my scientific research on machine learning and data science at the Federal University of Minas Gerais(UFMG), as a way to practice and get experience with the machine learning techniques that I am learning. I'm currently at the first semester of a 10-semester long Computer Science course, so I'm still new to coding and machine learning in general. With that in mind, this package isn't by any means meant to be on the same level of other big python packages for machine learning, such as scikitlearn or xgboost, instead it is built to at least have a comparable performance to the aforementioned packages when used to fit small to medium sized datasets. The package's functionalities are also easy-to-use and pretty intuitive, so it also provides a welcoming environment for newcomers.
